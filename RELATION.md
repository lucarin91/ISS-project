1.	 Introduction.	This	section	should	clearly	describe	â€“with	the	help	of	a	figure-	the	chosen	orchestration.	In	particular
which	are	the	inputs	and	outputs	of	the	orchestrator	and	of	the	service	invocations,	and	how	such	inputs	and
outputs	relate	one	another.	The	actual	addresses	of	the	employed	remote	services	must	be	explicitly	mentioned.

## Introduction
The	service	developed	is	called	BibleBraille,	and	as	is	name	its	goal	is	to	provide	a	Braille	translation	and	an	audio version	of	specific	verses	of	the	Bible.
More	in	detail	this	service	have	only	the	getVerse	SOAP	operation	that	as	can	be	see	in	the	WSDL	file (BibleBrailleWSDL.wsdl)	of	the	service	take	in	input:
- the	name	of	the	bible	book	(i.e.	genesis).
- the	number	of	chapter	of	that	book	(i.e.	1).
- the	specific	verse	of	the	chapter	(i.e.	1).

Than	the	service	elaborate	the	response	and	send	back	as	output:
- the	base64	binary	representation	of	the	braille	image.
- the	link	of	a	mp3	with	the	recording	of	the	verse.
- the	original	text	of	the	verse.

the service to compute the result use three external services:
- [**BibleWebservice**](http://www.webservicex.net/New/Home/ServiceDetail/6) (now on call A) a REST and SOAP bible service that retrieve a specific verse of the bible. The orchestrator use it to get the text of the requested bible verse, using the `GetBibleWordsByChapterAndVerse` SOAP operation, described in its WSDL (http://www.webservicex.net/BibleWebservice.asmx?WSDL)
- [**Text to Braille**](http://www.webservicex.net/New/Home/ServiceDetail/58) (now on call B) a REST and SOAP service that convert a plain text in braille, returning a base64Binary string representing an image. The orchestrotor use its `BrailleText` SOAP operation decribe in its WSDL (http://www.webservicex.net/braille.asmx?WSDL)
- [**ESV Bible webService**](http://www.esvapi.org/) (now on call C) a complete bible web service, that provide text and audio track of bible verse. The orchestrator use it only to get the link of audio track, using this REST resource: `http://www.esvapi.org/v2/rest/passageQuery.php/`

## WS-BPEL	implementation
The WS-BPEL of the service orchestrotor is composed in two parts, the **BibleBrailleComp** service, the real orchestration of the external service and the **BibleAudioProxy** a service proxy service for be able to asynchrounslly call the *ESV Bible webService* service, with doen't have this built in features. For now on we only speak about the main service, because this proxy doen't have any soffistecated logic, it only send back what receive by the bibleservice back to the orchestrator.

### WS-BPEL	processes
To achive the result the orchestrtor execute two part in parallel, the first one is the call of the service A to retrive the bible verse amd than invoke the service B to compute th braille conversion of the verse; in the second parallel part there is the asyncronous call of the service C to get the audio version of the verse and than wait for a callback.

The this last part we can have different outcome, in fact if the a callback message come before a timeout of 10 secons the service continous and the received message is analized, if not the all process is stopped and an to_fault is send back to the client. The message received by the proxy is then analysed and the url of the audio track is composed base on the id of the bible verse, if the verse serched is not found or other error shows up the process continous going but instead of the audio url is send back an error. In this case the client receive only the text version and the braille version of the requested verse.

This behaivor it can me possible by the use of two scope,
